## 🚀 How to Test Your Implementation

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Key Pages
Visit these URLs and verify they load quickly with server-rendered content:

- **Home Page**: `http://localhost:3000/`
  - ✅ Should show featured products immediately
  - ✅ Check "View Source" for complete HTML content
  - ✅ Images should be optimized (WebP format in Network tab)

- **Product Page**: `http://localhost:3000/product/[any-product-slug]`
  - ✅ Should show product details in page source
  - ✅ Meta tags should contain product information
  - ✅ Images should load with blur placeholders

- **Collections**: `http://localhost:3000/collections`
  - ✅ Should display collections immediately
  - ✅ Server-rendered content visible in source

- **Shop**: `http://localhost:3000/shop`
  - ✅ Categories should load server-side
  - ✅ Interactive filters should work client-side

### 3. Performance Testing
```bash
# Run automated performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Check build optimization
npm run build
npm run start
```

### 4. SEO Testing
- **View Page Source** - Should contain complete HTML content
- **Meta Tags** - Check for title, description, Open Graph tags
- **Social Sharing** - Test with Facebook Debugger, Twitter Card Validator

## 🔧 Expected Improvements

### Performance Gains
- **40-60% faster** initial page loads
- **50-70% improvement** in Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Images Not Loading
**Solution**: Check that `api.birdseyefashion.com` is in the `domains` array in `next.config.js`

### Issue 2: Hydration Errors
**Solution**: Ensure server and client render identical content. Check console for warnings.

### Issue 3: API Timeouts
**Solution**: Increase timeout values in `lib/api.ts` or check API server performance.

### Issue 4: Build Errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```
